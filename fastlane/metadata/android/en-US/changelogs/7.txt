You can no longer build the code at version 1.1.1+6 because Flutter has been updated and the Build_runner version defined in that version doesn't work anymore. Because of this we need to create a new release with updated dependencies, or else F-droid won't be able to build our source.

Changes:
<ul>
<li>Open metadata page by tapping on lighthouse instead of holding power button (holding the power button still works).</li>
<li>Added support for F-droid.</li>
<li>Updated dependencies.</li>
</ul>
